#you can pass multiple arguments to a fuction by separating them with commas: def function_name(argument1, argument2):
#remmber to provide all necessary arguments when calling the function: function_name(argument1, argument2)
#if you don't do this you will see an error of this kind:

#function_name() missing 1 required positional argument: 'argument2'

#or if you privide to many arguments:

#function_name() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
